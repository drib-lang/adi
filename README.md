While Drib may look like a normal programming language, it does not support numbers in the traditional sense. All numbers must be stored as strings, and arithmetic operations are performed using built-in functions that operate on these string representations. That is what makes Drib special; that is what makes Drib *esoteric*.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11**  
  _Note: Drib may work with other Python versions, but this has not been tested._

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drib-lang/adi.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd di
   ```
3. A virtual environment is not required.

## REPL

To start the Drib REPL, run:

```bash
python3 src/repl.py
```

## Planned Features

The following features are planned for future releases, but are not yet implemented:

- **Lists**: Support for list data structures and related operations.
- **Dictionaries**: Support for dictionary (key-value) data structures and related operations.
- **Image Processing**: Capabilities for handling and processing images within Drib programs.

If you have suggestions for additional features, feel free to open an issue or contribute!
